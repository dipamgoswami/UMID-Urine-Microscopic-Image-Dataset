# UMID-Urine-Microscopic-Image-Dataset

Analysis of urine sediment particles from microscopic images play a vital role in the diagnosis of kidney diseases. The patient's urine is subjected to centrifuging and the sediment(solid) part of the urine is taken in a glass slide and observed under the microscope. The clinical examination of the urine sediment requires skilled technicians who has expertise in identifying the cells from images. The trained technicians then count the number of various cells by visual inspection, which is labor-intensive, time-consuming and dependent on the technician.

We present a dataset comprising of 374 annotated microscopic images of urine sediments of dimensions (1280,720).
